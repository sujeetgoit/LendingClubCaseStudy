## General Information
Financial companies faces the critical task of assessing loan applications of urban customers  to make informed decisions. When evaluating loan applications, the company confronts two primary risks: denying a loan to a creditworthy applicant, resulting in a loss of business, or approving a loan to a borrower likely to default, thereby risking financial losses.
	
The objective is to analyze the past loan applicant's data  to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
## Approach to solution
The approach is to perform the following activities in sequence to identify the patterns for defaults:-
Data Cleaning 
Univariate Analysis
Bivariate Analysis

## Conclusions
- Small business are the riskiest to give loan to.
- Small business should be given loan at lower Interest Rate or less Loan amount, as these will reduce the risk of default.
- As the Grades move from A to G, default is increasing. Bank can focus of this parameter.
- Shorter duration loans(36 months) are paid more often
